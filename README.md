My name is Michael Ciccone. I am 28 years old and new to the world of software development. I have some minimal coding experience from using MATLAB in college. I currently work as a biomedical engineering technician at a local children's hospital, but am very excited to pursue a new career. In my free time I like to golf and lift weights. I can be reached at mciccone1995@gmail.com.
